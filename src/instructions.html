<P>VESPER is designed around cutting-edge HTML5 functionality and as such requires a modern web browser. The latest releases of <a href="www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a>,
    <a href="http://www.opera.com">Opera</a> (now WebKit based), <a href="http://support.apple.com/downloads/#safari">Safari</A> (for Mac), <a href="www.mozilla.org/firefox/">Firefox</A>,
    and <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/internet-explorer/download-ie">Internet Explorer</a> (9 or above) are suitable.
</P>

<H3>Loading DWCA Files</H3>
<P>
    There are five DWCA examples supplied, press the respective button to choose any of these files.
    If you’re using Chrome/Opera (which have implemented HTML5 local filesystems) there’s a button next to those to load your own DWCA (a file browser should pop up).
</P>

<P>
    After a quick initial loading to grab the DWCA's meta information, a small panel will appear detailing your next choices - it is basically a filter asking which data fields in the DWCA you'd like to analyse.
    Pick a field you’d like to use as a “name” in the taxonomy and map components – you may not have a choice here.
    Then pick which of the visualisations VESPER has deduced from the DWCA that the archive should be able to populate.
</P>
<P>
    When you’re happy with your selected visualisations, press “Load” and wait anything from a second or two (HIBG) to 30 seconds or so (the ENA file) for a new panel to appear.
    This is your “master view” for the loaded DWCA. Select any of the visualisation options it offers to spawn a visualisation panel of that type for the DWCA.
</P>

<H3>Basic Interaction</H3>
<P>
    In all components, a left mouse-click navigates and a right mouse-click selects.
    The map component has some extra selection options – press the circle, square, polygon icons to start selecting groups by drawing shapes around them.
    Each visualisation panel has an “x” in the corner to delete that particular view.
    Pressing the “x” in the corner of the “master view” kills all associated views for that data set.
    This effectively ends any more interaction with that data set (unless you load it again).
</P>

<P>
    Selections in one component are reflected in the other visible components, so a selection of a group on the map will show where these specimens occured in the timeline and in a taxonomy (assuming there is data for these views as well).
