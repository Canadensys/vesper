        <P>Use this tab to load in DWCA files from your computer or accessible network drives. It requires a browser that
        implements the HTML5 FileReader interface. If you have such a browser, a button will appear underneath. Click on that to select a file.
        If you don't have such a browser, you'll see an error message instead :-(
